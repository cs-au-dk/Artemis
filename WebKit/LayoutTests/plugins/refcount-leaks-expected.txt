Test that we can get an NPObject returned through a method on an NPAPI Object.
Prints "SUCCESS" on success, "FAILURE" on failure.  

--- num test objects:
countAfterCreate == countOrig + 3? PASS
countOrig == countAfterGC? PASS

--- refcount on plug.testObject:
originally: 2
after GC: 2
after passing: 2
SUCCESS
