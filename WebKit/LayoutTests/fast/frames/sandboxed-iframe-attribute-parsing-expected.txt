This test case verifies the parsing of the iframe sandbox attribute. Two sets of iframes are used: one where scripting is allowed, and another one where it is disallowed. The test verifies that the allowed frames execute scripts (but other sandboxed properties still apply -- specifically, forms are disabled), and the disallowed ones do not. If successful the test prints "PASS".

                  
PASS
