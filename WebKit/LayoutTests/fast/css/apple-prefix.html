<p>It was just last night, I think, that I was IM&#39;ing with a friend and I said, &quot;Next week Simon starts going to
school for 3 days extended (until 3pm) and Sophia starts swim camp! I won&#39;t know what to do with my free time! But I&#39;m
willing to find out.&quot;</p><p>You know the old saying: &quot;Man plans, God laughs.&quot;</p>
<p>Today I got a call from the preschool telling me that Sophia had broken her arm.</p>
<p>It happened on the playground. I imagined she had fallen off the monkey bars or something, but no: she had been sitting
at the Art Table, and as she was getting off the bench she slipped and fell on her arm. She was being very brave when I came
to get her—no tears, stoically holding her arm covered in ice packs. She <i>had</i> cried, she told me. All of the teachers
were quite amazed at how brave she was being. I took her to the doctor and from there to the pediatric orthopedic doctor.
She started to lose her composure, though, after she had finally gotten the X-rays (&quot;Like Curious George got when he
went to the hospital&quot;) and we had to wait in the exam room.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to go home now,&quot; she said. &quot;I wish I&#39;d never hurt my arm.&quot;</p>
<p>The ortho tech came in to give her a splint (she&#39;ll have a splint for a couple of days and then get a cast on Thursday),
and can I tell you how worrisome it is to have an ortho tech who is a <b>dead ringer</b> for Ian McShane as Al Swearengen
wrapping up your daughter in gauze? (I&#39;m totally serious. He didn&#39;t have grease in his hair, and he didn&#39;t have the
little beard under his lip, but other than that: yup.)</p>
<p>So now she&#39;s on the couch, watching &quot;Dragontales&quot; with her arm propped up on a pillow (to keep it above the heart).
She&#39;s eating a couple of cut-up apples and cheese sticks (&quot;because that&#39;s all I can eat now, Mommy&quot;).</p>
<p>She&#39;s upset because she&#39;s not going to be able to do all the swimming she was planning. I&#39;m upset because my
little girl got hurt. I assume that after a day or so we&#39;ll adjust to the new regimen. Of course, she can&#39;t go to her last
day of preschool tomorrow, because they&#39;re having &quot;Water Days,&quot; and she can&#39;t get wet.</p>
<p>The weather&#39;s finally gotten extremely hot around here, and she can&#39;t get her splint (and in a few days, her cast) wet. <i>Neat.</i></p>
<p>I&#39;ve never broken anything (knock on nearest wood sprite)—does it affect your outlook on life?
She has an adventuresome spirit and I hope she&#39;s just as energetic after this little incident as she was before.
At the moment she&#39;s even lost her sense of humor.</p>
