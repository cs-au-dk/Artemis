This test verifies that DOM nodes are not retained just because a wrapper exists for a descendant. A wrapper must exist for the node itself or for an ancestor.

The output should be the following pieces of text on lines by themselves: "replacement content", "B", "child node exists".

replacement content
B
child node exists
