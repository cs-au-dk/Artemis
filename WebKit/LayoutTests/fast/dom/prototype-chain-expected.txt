This page prints out the prototype chains of select DOM objects. Older versions of WebCore didn't properly implement prototype chaining for these objects.

NOTE: This test will start failing if you change the layout of a related prototype chain in WebCore. That does not necessarily mean that you have done something wrong; you may just need to check in new results.
