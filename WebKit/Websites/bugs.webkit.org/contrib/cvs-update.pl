# Keep a record of all cvs updates made from a given directory.
#
# Later, if changes need to be backed out, look at the log file
# and run the cvs command with the date that you want to back
# out to. (Probably the second to last entry).

# Because this script lives in contrib, you may want to
#   ln -s contrib/cvs-update.pl cvs-update.pl
# from your bugzilla install directory so you can run
# the script easily from there (./cvs-update.pl)
