# runs checksetup, it finds out "Oh, there is something new". Then it adds

# check that to see if it is what the user wants.

=head1 NAME

Bugzilla::Install::Localconfig - Functions and variables dealing
  with the manipulation and creation of the F<localconfig> file.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bugzilla::Install::Requirements qw(update_localconfig);
 update_localconfig({ output => 1 });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is used primarily by L<checksetup.pl> to create and
modify the localconfig file. Most scripts should use L<Bugzilla/localconfig>
to access localconfig variables.

=head1 CONSTANTS

=over

=item C<LOCALCONFIG_VARS>

An array of hashrefs. These hashrefs contain three keys:

 name    - The name of the variable.
 default - The default value for the variable. Should always be
           something that can fit in a scalar.
 desc    - Additional text to put in localconfig before the variable
           definition. Must end in a newline. Each line should start
           with "#" unless you have some REALLY good reason not
           to do that.

=item C<OLD_LOCALCONFIG_VARS>

An array of names of variables. If C<update_localconfig> finds these
variables defined in localconfig, it will print out a warning.

=back

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=over

=item C<read_localconfig($include_deprecated)>

Description: Reads the localconfig file and returns all valid
             values in a hashref.

Params:      C<$include_deprecated> - C<true> if you want the returned
                 hashref to also include variables listed in 
                 C<OLD_LOCALCONFIG_VARS>, if they exist. Generally
                 this is only for use by C<update_localconfig>.

Returns:     A hashref of the localconfig variables. If an array
             is defined, it will be an arrayref in the returned hash. If a
             hash is defined, it will be a hashref in the returned hash.
             Only includes variables specified in C<LOCALCONFIG_VARS>
             (and C<OLD_LOCALCONFIG_VARS> if C<$include_deprecated> is
             specified).

=item C<update_localconfig({ output =E<gt> 1 })>

Description: Adds any new variables to localconfig that aren't
             currently defined there. Also optionally prints out
             a message about vars that *should* be there and aren't.
             Exits the program if it adds any new vars.

Params:      C<output> - C<true> if the function should display informational
                 output and warnings. It will always display errors or
                 any message which would cause program execution to halt.

Returns:     A hashref, with C<old_vals> being an array of names of variables
             that were removed, and C<new_vals> being an array of names
             of variables that were added to localconfig.
