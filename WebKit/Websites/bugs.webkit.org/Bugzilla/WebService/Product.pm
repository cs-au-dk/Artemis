Note: Can also be called as "get_products" for compatibilty with Bugzilla 3.0 API.

=item B<Params>

A hash containing one item, C<ids>, that is an array of product ids. 

=item B<Returns> 

A hash containing one item, C<products>, that is an array of
hashes. Each hash describes a product, and has the following items:
C<id>, C<name>, C<description>, and C<internals>. The C<id> item is
the id of the product. The C<name> item is the name of the
product. The C<description> is the description of the
product. Finally, the C<internals> is an internal representation of
the product.

Note, that if the user tries to access a product that is not in the
list of accessible products for the user, or a product that does not
exist, that is silently ignored, and no information about that product
is returned.
