<h2>HTML and XHTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This is the home page for work on WebKit's HTML and XHTML implementation.  HTML work generally falls into four categories:
work on site compatibility and handling of invalid HTML, work on finishing HTML4 support, extensions to HTML like the 
canvas element used in Dashboard, and XHTML work.

<dl>
<dt>Complete HTML4 Support</dt>
<dd>There are a handful of HTML4 issues remaining, including adding support for a few more attributes for legacy HTML
to APPLET and OBJECT, implementing the BDO element, and implementing alignment inheritance in table columns.</dd>
<dt>Improve XHTML</dt>
<dd>We want to improve our XHTML rendering, making it as incremental as HTML and making sure entity support and scripts work properly.
<dt>Extend HTML</dt>
<dd>We are interested in the WhatWG work to extend HTML to have functionality that has not been covered in any other HTML specifications.
