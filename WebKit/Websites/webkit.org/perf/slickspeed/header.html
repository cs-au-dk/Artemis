<h2>speed/validity selectors test for frameworks.</h2>
<p>Every framework runs in its own iFrame, thus no conflicts can happen. Tests are run selector by selector, with an interval to prevent the browser from freezing.</p>
<p>Tests are run in a neutral environment, no library or framework is included in the main javascript test, to avoid favoritism.</p>
<p>The WebKit version of this test includes a number of modifications. Specifically
<ul>
<li>The tests are run 250 times instead of once to show speed differences more accurately</li>
<li>querySelectorAll is added as a supported &quot;library&quot;</li>
<li>CSS selectors that not all implementations support have been removed to avoid distorting timing results. These will be added back in as new selectors are implemented.</li>
</ul>
</p>
