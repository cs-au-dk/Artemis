==============================================
 Running a GTK+ build slave under daemontools
==============================================

This directory contains several scripts which can be used to run a WebKitGTK+
build slave under daemontools [1]. This is convenient because daemontools
will automatically restart services when they die, and that means less human
intervention is needed.


Dependencies
============

In order to use the provided service control files, you will need the
following:

* The GNU Bash shell (the scripts contain some bash-isms)

* The daemontools package (or one of its drop-in replacements, like runit
  or freedt; but only daemontools has been tested so far).

* The crash dump monitor also uses "inotifywait" (part of inotify-tools [2])

In short, in a Debian-based system you can ensure you have the needed bits
with the following command:

  apt-get install inotify-tools daemontools-run


Setup
=====

1. Follow the instructions at http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/BuildBot

2. Install the dependencies outlined above.

3. Copy "daemontools-buildbot.conf" to "/etc/daemontools-buildbot.conf"

4. Edit the configuration file to suit your needs, the comments should
   be self-explanatory.

5. Drop the "buildbot", "pulseaudio" and "xvfb" directories (plus
   "crashmon", if desired) to the service control directory of
   daemontools; for Debian-based setups that would be "/etc/service"
