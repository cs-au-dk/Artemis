 
The following instructions assumes you are using a (64 bit) Linux-based system. 
Artemis have been successfully installed on Ubuntu 12.10 and Fedora 18.

 0. Fetch all software dependencies using
    
      make fetch-[apt|yum] (requires root privileges)
	
    Artemis requires Qt version 4.8.x. If a suitable version of Qt is not 
    provided by your distribution, then you can use the following command
    to download and compile a version compatible with Artemis.

      make fetch-qt

    This will place a version of Qt 4.8 in the `qt/` folder.

    You can check your Qt version using the command ``qmake --version``
    (if qmake is missing then Qt is not installed).
    
 1. Configure your environment variables by running
    
      export QTDIR=<qt_path>
      export PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
      export ARTEMISDIR=<artemis_git_reposity_path>

    where `<qt_path>` is the QT 4.8 installation directory, either
    the one provided by your distribution or the `qt/` folder 
    mentioned in step 0, and where `<artemis_git_repository_path>` 
    is the directory with this INSTALL file in it.

    `<qt_path>` is /usr/share/qt4 on Ubuntu systems and
    /usr/lib64/qt4/bin on Fedora.
     
 2. Build Artemis
   
   	  make all

 3. Add the instrumented WebKit library to your library path

      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ARTEMISDIR/WebKit/WebKitBuild/Release/lib  

    This environment variable is needed every time you wish to
    execute Artemis.

4. Configure your path to include Artemis executable

      export PATH=$ARTEMISDIR/artemis-code/dist:$PATH
