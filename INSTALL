 0. Fetch all software dependencies using
    
        make fetch-[apt|yum]
	make fetch-qt
    
 1. Set up your environment variables by running
    
        export ARTEMIS_PATH=<path>
	source artemis-env

    where `<path>` is the desired destination of the Artemis binaries
    and its associated libraries.
     
 2. Build and install Artemis
   
   	make install



Note: you will need to either add
      `ARTEMIS_PATH/WebKit/WebKitBuild/Release/lib` to the environment
      variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or execute step 1 everytime you
      subsequently wish to use Artemis.
