 
The following instructions assumes you are using a (64 bit) Linux-based system. 
Artemis have been successfully installed on Ubuntu 12.10 and Fedora 18.

 0. Fetch all software dependencies using
    
      make fetch-[apt|yum] (requires root privileges)
	
    Artemis requires Qt version 4.8.x. If a suitable version of Qt is not 
    provided by your distribution, then you can use the following command
    to download and compile a version compatible with Artemis.

      make fetch-qt

    This will place a version of Qt 4.8 in the `qt/` folder.

    You can check your Qt version using the command ``qmake --version``
    (if qmake is missing then Qt is not installed). Note, you need to 
    set the QTDIR and PATH variables described in step 1.
    
 1. Configure your environment variables by running
    
      export QTDIR=<qt_path>
      export PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
      export ARTEMISDIR=<artemis_git_reposity_path>

    where `<qt_path>` is the QT 4.8 installation directory, either
    the one provided by your distribution or the `qt/` folder 
    mentioned in step 0, and where `<artemis_git_repository_path>` 
    is the directory with this INSTALL file in it.

    `<qt_path>` is /usr/share/qt4 on Ubuntu systems and
    /usr/lib64/qt4/bin on Fedora.
     
 2. Build Artemis
   
   	  make all

 3. Add the instrumented WebKit library to your library path

      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ARTEMISDIR/WebKit/WebKitBuild/Release/lib  

    This environment variable is needed every time you wish to
    execute Artemis.

4. Configure your path to include Artemis executable

      export PATH=$ARTEMISDIR/artemis-code/dist:$PATH

5. Enable auto-completion in bash by running
      
      mv artemis-bash-complete /etc/bash-complete.d/artemis 
   
   as root.
